**Clock**

This simple Digital Clock app was inspired by a previous project I made - [Analogue Clock](https://github.com/artursbridaks/Analogue-Clock). The main goal was to freshen up HTML, CSS, a little bit of JavaScript and learn new tricks and details. The making of a digital clock was way simplier than I previously thought. Which only means that from now on I will take on more complex projects with JavaScript. To make it a little bit more complex, I made color scheme buttons. Taking these smaller projects only to gradually improve my JavaScript skills. 

**Introduction**

To run the app:

* Clone the app to your local machine
* Opening the project:
    * Open the html file within the folder (don't take it out)
    * Open the project on Visual Studio Code
        * To run the live-server press ALT+L+O
        * (or press the "Go Live" button on the lower right-hand sight)
* Either way: 
    * The browser should open automatically
